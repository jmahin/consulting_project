<h1>About</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Mahin and I'm from Boston, MA. I currently work in software quality assurance in the ed. tech industry. In 2022, I participated in the <a href="https://codesquad.org">CodeSquad</a> bootcamp, where I learnt HTML, CSS, Node.js, and MongoDB. I'm hoping to add React to my quiver in the near future. In the meanwhile, I am currently applying to bridge master's in computer science.</p>
<h2>An unconventional path to web development</h2>
<p>I graduated from <a href="https://umass.edu">UMass Amherst</a> in 2o18 with two degrees: biochemistry and environmental science. While I remain interested in my field of study, by reading journal articles and attending lectures, I haven't pursued a career <u>directly</u> related to either.
